![EntryPoints](../assets/img/entrypoints.png)

Entrypoints are the network entry points into Traefik.
They can be defined using:

- a port (80, 443, ...)
- SSL (Certificates, Keys, authentication with a client certificate signed by a trusted CA, ...)

## Configuration Examples

??? example "HTTP only"

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
      address = ":80"
    ```

    We define an `entrypoint` called `http` that will listen on port `80`.

??? example "HTTP & HTTPS" 

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
        address = ":80"
    
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
        
        [entryPoints.https.tls]
          [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
            certFile = "tests/traefik.crt"
            keyFile = "tests/traefik.key"
    ```

    - Two entrypoints are defined: one called `http`, and the other called `https`.
    - `http` listens on port `80`, and `https` on port `443`.
    - We enabled SSL on `https` by giving it a certificate and a key.

    !!! note
    
        In the example, `http` and `https` are the names for the entrypoints and have nothing to do with the underlying protocol.
        We could have written `entryPoints.foo` and `entryPoints.bar` instead. 
    
    !!! tip "Automatic HTTPS with ACME"
       
        If you don't have certificate files and wish to automatically enable HTTPS, you should have a look at one of Traefik's most praised feature: [ACME & Let's Encrypt integration](./acme.md)

??? example "Client Certificate Authentication"

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
      
      [entryPoints.https.tls]
        [entryPoints.https.tls.ClientCA]
          files = ["tests/clientca1.crt", "tests/clientca2.crt"]
          optional = false
        
        [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
          certFile = "tests/traefik.crt"
          keyFile = "tests/traefik.key"
    ```
    
    - We enabled SSL on `https` by giving it a certificate and a key.
    - Files containing Certificate Authorities (PEM format) were added.
    
    !!! note "Multiple CAs" 
    
        It is possible to have multiple CA:s in the same file or keep them in separate files.

## Configuration

### General

Entrypoints are part of the [static configuration](../getting-started/configuration-overview.md#the-static-configuration). You can define them using a toml file, CLI arguments, or a key-value store. See the [complete reference](../reference/entrypoints.md) for the list of available options. 

??? example "Using the CLI"

    Here is an example of using the CLI to define `entrypoints`:
    
    ```shell
    --entryPoints='Name:http Address::80'
    --entryPoints='Name:https Address::443 TLS'
    ```
    
    !!! note
        The whitespace character (` `) is the option separator, and the comma (`,`) is the value separator for lists.  
        The option names are case-insensitive.
    
    !!! warning "Using Docker Compose Files"
    
        The syntax for passing arguments inside a docker compose file is a little different. Here are two examples.
        
        ```yaml
        traefik:
            image: traefik
            command:
                - --defaultentrypoints=powpow
                - "--entryPoints=Name:powpow Address::42 Compress:true"
        ```

        or
        
        ```yaml
        traefik:
            image: traefik
            command: --defaultentrypoints=powpow --entryPoints='Name:powpow Address::42 Compress:true'
        ```

## TLS

### Static Certificates

To add SNI support, define `certFile` and `keyFile`.

```toml
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.https]
    address = ":443"
    
    [entryPoints.https.tls]
      [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
        certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert"
        keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key"
```

!!! note
    If you provide an empty TLS configuration, default self-signed certificates will be generated.

### Dynamic Certificates

To add / remove TLS certificates while Traefik is running, the [file provider](../providers/file.md) supports Dynamic TLS certificates in its `[[tls]]` section.

### Mutual Authentication

Traefik supports both optional and non optional (defaut value) mutual authentication.

- When `optional = false`, Traefik accepts connections only from client presenting a certificate signed by a CA listed in `ClientCA.files`.
- When `optional = true`, Traefik authorizes connections from client presenting a certificate signed by an unknown CA. 

??? example "Non Optional Mutual Authentication"
    
    In the following example, both `snitest.com` and `snitest.org` will require client certificates.

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
        
        [entryPoints.https.tls]
          [entryPoints.https.tls.ClientCA]
            files = ["tests/clientca1.crt", "tests/clientca2.crt"]
            optional = false
            
            [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
              certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert"
              keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key"
            [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
              certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.cert"
              keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.key"
    ```
    
    !!! note "ClientCA.files"

        You can use a file per `CA:s`, or a single file containing multiple `CA:s` (in `PEM` format).

        `ClientCA.files` is not optional: every client will have to present a valid certificate. (This requirement will apply to every server certificate declared in the entrypoint.)

### Minimum TLS Version

??? example "Min TLS version & [cipherSuites](https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#pkg-constants)"

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
        
        [entryPoints.https.tls]
          minVersion = "VersionTLS12"
          cipherSuites = [
            "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
            "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
          ]
          
          [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
            certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert"
            keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key"
          [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
            certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.cert"
            keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.key"
    ```

### Strict SNI Checking

With strict SNI checking, Traefik won't allow connections without a matching certificate.

??? example "Strict SNI"
 
    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
      
        [entryPoints.https.tls]
          sniStrict = true
          
          [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
            certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert"
            keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key"
    ```

### Default Certificate

Traefik can use a default certificate for connections without an SNI, or without a matching domain.

If no default certificate is provided, Traefik generates a self-signed and use it instead.

??? example "Setting a Default Certificate"
 
    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.https]
        address = ":443"
        
        [entryPoints.https.tls]
          [entryPoints.https.tls.defaultCertificate]
            certFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert"
            keyFile = "integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key"
    ```
    
    !!! note "Only One Default Certificate"
        There can only be one `defaultCertificate` per entrypoint.

## ProxyProtocol

Traefik supports [ProxyProtocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt).

??? example "Enabling Proxy Protocol with Trusted IPs" 

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
        address = ":80"
    
        [entryPoints.http.proxyProtocol]
          trustedIPs = ["127.0.0.1/32", "192.168.1.7"]
    ```
    
    IPs in `trustedIPs` only will lead to remote client address replacement: Declare load-balancer IPs or CIDR range here.
    
??? example "Insecure Mode -- Testing Environnement Only"

    In a test environments, you can configure Traefik to trust every incomming connection. Doing so, every remote client address will be replaced (`trustedIPs` won't have any effect)

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
        address = ":80"
    
        [entryPoints.http.proxyProtocol]
          insecure = true
    ```
         
!!! warning "Queuing Traefik behind Another Load Balancer"

    When queuing Traefik behind another load-balancer, make sure to configure Proxy Protocol on both sides.
    Not doing so could introduce a security risk in your system (enabling request forgery).

## Forwarded Header

You can configure Traefik to trust the forwarded headers information (`X-Forwarded-*`)

??? example "Trusting Forwarded Headers from specific IPs"

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
        address = ":80"
    
        [entryPoints.http.forwardedHeaders]
          trustedIPs = ["127.0.0.1/32", "192.168.1.7"]
    ```
    
??? example "Insecure Mode -- Always Trusting Forwarded Headers"

    ```toml
    [entryPoints]
      [entryPoints.http]
        address = ":80"
    
        [entryPoints.http.forwardedHeaders]
           insecure = true
    ```

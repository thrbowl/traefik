The easiest way to submit a pre-filled issue on [Traefik GitHub](https://github.com/containous/traefik)! Watch [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyz62L8m93I) for more information.

```bash
traefik bug
```

### Command: healthcheck

Checks the health of Traefik.
Its exit status is `0` if Traefik is healthy and `1` if it is unhealthy.

This can be used with Docker [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) instruction or any other health check orchestration mechanism.

!!! note
    The [`ping` endpoint](../ping/) must be enabled to allow the `healthcheck` command to call `/ping`.

```bash
traefik healthcheck
```

```bash
OK: http://:8082/ping
```
